This recipe is the recipe of my favorite drink, a caramel frappe! A caramel frappe is a sweetened cold coffee drink which is caramel flavored! It is really sweet and delicious! You can get it from Starbucks (if you prefer a coffee taste instead of sweet) or McDonald's (if you prefer a more sweet and sugary drink with less coffee). But this recipe is homemade, so you can customize it to taste! Enjoy!
